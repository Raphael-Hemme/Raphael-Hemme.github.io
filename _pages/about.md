This is an experiment in blogging.
## About me:
Trained as a cultural anthropologist, I recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and decided to take up blogging as a way to document the many little things I learn about both, culture and coding - but especially the point of convergence: the cultures of coding and computational culture.

## About the blog:
**TL:DR:**

Given some time, I hope that associations and aggregations emerge from the many small or even atomic notes that constitue the content of this blog. That is what I call **"semantic molecules"**.

----

This blog is intended to store insights I gain on my coding journey as well as summaries, takeaways or thoughts on topics and sources I encounter in my everyday life and in my academic work. The latter could be  anything from inspiring talks, books, articles, blog posts, films, exhibitions or podcasts and so on.

In order to systematize the content a bit, I will use two main categories for posts:
* coding practice
* cultures of computing

*cultures of computing being a direct reference to Susan Leigh Star's (et al.) volume: "The cultures of computing"*

Being strongly influenced by praxeography, this should not, however, be considered a clear demarcation of theory and practice etc. but just a simple enough systematization to allow me (and possibly you too) to find posts that will be quite different in their respective goals and styles.

Aside from that, it is probably useful to have a third category for all the other stuff that might come up. :wink: Let's call it:
* float.

*You may read that as a reference to the trouble I had trying to align things correctly in the css / scss files I customized from the minimal mistakes theme, whiche uses floats extensively, while I am much more used to flexbox and grid systems. So, floats - for me - never tend to work the way I expect them to. Which is quite a nice analogy, because this is probably the same for thoughts and texts that I can't fit in this evil, rigid system of "coding practice" and "cultures of computing".*

*Thinking about the name semantic molecules, I must admit that it is quite long. So if you can't remember the name, maybe just abreviate it to **"semi-cule"** and pronounce it **"semi cool"**.* :wink: *At least it might help retention.*
