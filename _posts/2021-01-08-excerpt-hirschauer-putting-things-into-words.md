## Context
I'm currently preparing a course on "Ethnographies of Computing Environments" at Ruhr Univerity Bochum. As part of that, I need to introduce students to the general concepts of ethnography which I usually really enjoy.
But I have not been entirely happy with the reading I assigned for that general intro to ethnography because even though I think it is a valid introductory text, I think it approaches "culture" too much through language and the taxonomic ordering of our everyday interactions. In that, the text is strongly influenced by cognitive anthropology / ethnoscience while I would like to introduce students also to a more practice oriented way of doing (or at least understanding) ethnography (-> praxeogrphy / prxiography).

To rephrase the old academic debate: Culture is not just what stories people tell about their worlds or how they categorize and perceive it, but at least as much about what they do and how they do it. And going one step further, ethnography is not even just observing what **people** do but also noticing what all the **non-human actors** (from animals to architecture and from fungi to transmission protocols) do and and how they participate in the production of actual social formations.

While I was searching for a good text to counter this language bias and anthropocentrism, I read an excellent [paper](https://www.theorie.soziologie.uni-mainz.de/files/2019/09/2006_HumStud_Putting-Things-Into-Words.pdf) by [Stefan Hirschauer](https://www.grc.uni-mainz.de/prof-stefan-hirschauer/) who argues that ethnography's "referential problem" is to verbaly articulate that which is not expressed in words yet - the silent. For the course, I think the whole text is to dense, but I think that reading a few key passages together and maybe staging a debate after that could be a good way to give a richer impression of what ethnography might be.

What follows is an excerpt of some of the key points and some quotes I took out of it but it is by no means a full summary. If you are interested in the arguments layed out by Hirschauer, I would encourage you to read the whole paper!

## Excerpt

**Full title:** Putting things into words. Wthnographic description and the silence of the social. 

Hirschauer's [paper](https://www.theorie.soziologie.uni-mainz.de/files/2019/09/2006_HumStud_Putting-Things-Into-Words.pdf) unfolds its arguments around the initial proposition that ethnography should not be understood as a form of naturalistic documentation of human knowledge which could be primarily studied through verbal expressions (spoken or written words that are frequently elicited and recorded in interview situations) but instead as a way to describe the "'silent' dimension of the social".

As part of a general introduction which gives a great overview of the academic debates concerning ethnographic writing and description that constitute the context for Hirschauer's question and argument, the paper dives deeper into "The problem of forgetting: noting and recording" (415-419) and offers an excurse on the question "Can recordings preserve an original" (419-422). I do not focus on those sections of the text, however, and turn to the different forms of "silence" instead. 

Hirschauer differentiates the following aspects in the silent dimension of the social:
* **The voiceless**
  * The incomprehensible: The things we do not understand without contexual translation -> Thick Description (Geertz)
  * The voices surpressed through strong hierarchies -> Voicing of the unheard and surpressed
  * The unmentionable: Things you are morally forbidden or discouraged to say -> Sensitively decide what may remain unspoken or "transfered" in more subtle ways 
* **Speechlessness**
  * The impressions and sensual experiences we can't put into words that easily (especially under the constraints of their fast unfolding) -> the ethnographic distancing from the situation of their unfolding which is somewhat paradoxically but true "the retreat to writing (in the field)" or in the own "office". Which is a form of socializing the personal experience (427) because experiences "are preformatted through various codes, they occure already structured by all those categories the available languages (i.e., of everyday life, of the field, of the discipline) allow for (semantically and grammatically)" (ibid). 
* **The indescribable**
  * What can not be easily verbalized because it is to complex or has multiple meanings
  * The complexity of a situation can result from the rich array of "channels" an observer perceives it in contrast to the reduced "channels" a recording device like a voice recorder or video camera can capture a situation.
  * The pace of any given event can render attempts impossible to capture it live in written words and keep the temporal order intact. -> If the temporal structure of micro-situations is important, recording devices might help to preserve it. But instead of *just* collecting an array of short recordings the strength of ethnography lies in the ability to describe  long term processes and the contextual embedding of micro situations (in addition to their recording).
  * Excurse: "Pre-configuration" of the observer's perception and attention by the very intention of describing a situation (430).
* **The pre-lingual**
  * Tacit and embodied knowledge playing out in our routines and habits. Think of touch typing or tying your shoes but also of your gaze or posture while greeting a friend or traversing a group of people etc. (Also see the quote below)
* **Things taken for granted**
  * The obvious, common knowledge and the banal that does not need to be spelled out because presumably everybodey knows already. This is *obviously* :wink: (for social scientists and the like) something that differs between "cultures". 
* **Muteness**
  * The "utterances" of (especially self animeted) non-human (or non talking) entities that do not at all adhere to any form of human language or "signification". Here, Hirschauer lists among others e.g. fetuses, animals and machines. 
  * Another question related to muteness that Hirschauer poses is "whose terminology should be used for description, when only one side is speaking?" which directs the text to a short excurse on Science Studies and Actor-Network Theory.

  -> *While I generally wholeheartedly agree, that it is important to also consider non-human entities and their utterances, I do wonder if it is actually correct to classify the signals machines emit to communicate with each other as something that is generally different from human language and signification since all the codes and protocolls are a. made by humans, b. relatively easy to translata into human language and and c. actually do signify things that adhere to human language. One exception I cna think of, might be signals and codes that completely emerged from artificial neural networks or similar. I don't have a definitive answer on that but I like the way, Hirschauer classified machine signals as different from human language and signification since it made me pause and think. This question will probably stay on my mind for a while. Thanks!*

In the last paragraphs, Hirschauer summarizes his arguments and answers two additional questions that he derives from it:
1. How to controll the accuracy or adequacy of ethnographic description compared to technical recordings?
2. If ethnographic description is not primarily about documenting thomething exactly, what other values does it offer?


Some quotes that I found particularly clear and concise (Even though the whole text is very well written and clear in its arguments):
