## Context
I'm currently preparing a course on "Ethnographies of Computing Environments" at Ruhr Univerity Bochum. As part of that, I need to introduce students to the general concepts of ethnography which I usually really enjoy.
But I have not been entirely happy with the reading I assigned for that general intro to ethnography because even though I think it is a valid introductory text, I think it approaches "culture" too much through language and the taxonomic ordering of our everyday interactions. In that, the text is strongly influenced by cognitive anthropology / ethnoscience while I would like to introduce students also to a more practice oriented way of doing (or at least understanding) ethnography (-> praxeogrphy / prxiography).

To rephrase the old academic debate: Culture is not just what stories people tell about their worlds or how they categorize and perceive it, but at least as much about what they do and how they do it. And going one step further, ethnography is not even just observing what **people** do but also noticing what all the **non-human actors** (from animals to architecture and from fungi to transmission protocols) do and and how they participate in the production of actual social formations.

While I was searching for a good text to counter this language bias and anthropocentrism, I read an excellent paper by Stefan Hirschauer who argues that ethnography's "referential problem" is to verbaly articulate that which is not expressed in words yet - the silent. For the course, I think the whole text is to dense, but I think that reading a few key passages together and maybe staging a debate after that could be a good way to give a richer impression of what ethnography might be.

What follows is an excerpt of some of the key points and some quotes I took out of it but it is by no means a full summary. If you are interested in the arguments layed out by Hirschauer, I would encourage you to read the whole paper!

## Excerpt
Hirschauer's paper unfolds its arguments around the initial proposition that ethnography should not be understood as a form of naturalistic documentation of human knowledge which could be primarily studied through verbal expressions (spoken or written words that are frequently elicited and recorded in interview situations) but instead as a way to describe the "'silent' dimension of the social".

This silent dimension comprises the following aspects:
* The voiceless
  * The incomprehensible: The things we do not understand without contexual translation -> Thick Description (Geertz)
  * The voices surpressed through strong hierarchies -> Voicing of the unheard and surpressed
  * The unmentionable: Things you are morally forbidden or discouraged to say -> Sensitively decide what may remain unspoken or "transfered" in more subtle ways 
* Speechlessness
  * The impressions and sensual experiences we can't put into words that easily (especially under the constraints of their fast unfolding) -> the ethnographic distancing from the situation of their unfolding which is somewhat paradoxically but true "the retreat to writing (in the field)" or in the own "office". Which is a form of socializing the personal experience (427) because experiences "are preformatted through various codes, they occure already structured by all those categories the available languages (i.e., of everyday life, of the field, of the discipline) allow for (semantically and grammatically)" (ibid). 
* The indescribable
* The pre-lingual
* Things taken for granted
* Muteness
