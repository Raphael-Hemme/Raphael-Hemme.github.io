Over the last few days, I worked on the logo for my portfolio site and found myself quite challenged by a really simple character - the "H" in my initials.

Did you ever try to come up with a somewhat new[^fn1], interesting and also visually pleasing way of constructing an alphabetic character? If so, you will probably have experienced your own preferences for certain letters over others that you might find more challenging. For a long time, I have had the feeling that there are some letters that are much easier to work with than others. For example, working with a "C" or an "O"[^fn2] to me is much more difficult, than working with characters like "A", "K", "E" etc.

I assume that professional typographers got over this personal preference and appreciate every character for what it is. Imagine, for second, a group of really experienced typographers. I see grey haired masters of their craft tracing the perfect line with a sharp pencil or ink-soaked brush and absolute body control. Of course, their minds remain in a fully focused zen-state and therefore detatched from the illusion of self and its petty preferences.

If that characterization did not sound particularly convincing and realistic to you, rest assured, it did not to me either.
But writing it down helped me realize that probably most professional typographers have not yet attained typographic enlightenment and still might feel a stronger appeal of specific characters. Rethinking this image of advanced typographers (or designers or developers or whichever profession you might feel intimidated by) as still quite human, actually made typography and design appear as more approachable fields of "study" to me again. So a positive side effect of writing this blog post is that it motivated me to learn more about the "theoretical" concepts of typography instead of just going with my gut feeling and my own thinking of and with letters like I have for years.

But back to the challenge a really simple character might present you with: After a few experiments with different subjects, I decided to go for a relatively minimalist and a little futuristic logo and since it is for my portfolio site, I came to the conclusion that my initials should be a simple but appropriate choice for what should take center stage in it.

But that is where I encountered the challenging letter "H" (not for the first time of course but with a new intensity). Think about it: the **H** is such a basic structure - two stems and a crossbar connecting them. And since I had no interest in some *blackletter* / *german type* or *cursive* typeface, that is it. Just two stems and a crossbar.  
Additionally, I had to connect it to the **R** in some way which was an additional challenge since in contrast to the *H*, the *R*, to me, is much more versatile. From a dead serious character in a state agency to the playful imaginary fiend of you inner child, the *R* can take almost any form. 

In contrast to that, I browsed the *serif* and *sans-serif* sections of open / free font libraries for quite a while to find inspiring new ways to draw an *H*. But the most variation, I found was the difference in the vertical positioning of the crossbar - sometimes being placed slightly below or above the vertical center of the stems and most often almost at the center. 

This letter got to be the secret emblem of some esoteric, rationalist-minimalist circle. I can almost see the members of that circle encountering each other on the streets of London, exchanging conspiratorial glances while forming an **H** with their hands half covered by long coats, then mumbling "I renounce all form without strict function" and wandering off into the fog. I said, I can almost see it because even forming an H with your hand is not that easy. Especially if you try to cover it with your coat.

There I was, sitting at my desk with this uneasy copany of letters. How to conciliate the versatility of the *R* with the austerity of the *H*?

At first, I thought: "Ok, let's make them just really bold and set them in italics. But that did not look particularly interesting or memorable.

Next, I decided to try "forcing" the *H* into the same regime of experimental proportions, and variable angles that evolved in the iterative work with the *R*.

As can see in the series of sketches labled with an circled "A", the *H* does not respond well to being subjected to an asymetrical change in the tilt angle of just one stem. While I think the small combination at the bottom with just the lower parts of the stems being (partly) tilted while the upper parts are straight, does almost work, It disrespects the fundamental shape of an *H* too much in my view. It almost reminds me of a *k* in some way. So that did not work either. 


[^fn1]: Of course "there is nothing new under the sun" as we all now and probably even less then nothing in a field that has a tradition going back thousands of years. 
[^fn2]: In the case of the "O" you could at least cheat and go for some circular shaped object to substitute the "O" with in a given string. But that is a kind of cheating and wouldn't be a viable option if you actually want to write text with it instead of just a few charters like you would when lettering a name etc.
