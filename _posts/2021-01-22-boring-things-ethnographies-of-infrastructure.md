Susan Leigh Star
**Full title:**  
Infrastructure and Ethnographic Practice: Working on the Fringes

### Summary and key points


### Quotes
Quotes that I found particularly clear and concise (even though the whole text is very well written and clear in its arguments):

Regarding the difficulty to study infrastructure ethnographically: 
> "The first barrier to using fieldwork is seeing infrastructure, and that means getting past the first take on information infrastructure â€“ that it is boring, not as exciting as the traditional issues fieldwork is so good at 'catching.' At first try, using fieldwork to stand and watch people punching keys and looking at screens is terribly difficult for trying to see social order. Or, in fact, to see much of anything. (...)  
As I have noted, for historical reasons, infrastructure is usually singularly unexciting as a research object for ethnographers. The human, symbolic, interactive aspects of infrastructure are terribly difficult for ethnographers to 'open up' in the way that we easily may open up conversations, rituals or gestures. Infrastructure often appears simply as a list of numbers of technical specifications, or black boxes, wires and plugs, in the scientific/disciplinary workplace. (Where is the human behavior side of that?)"
